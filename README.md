## Installation

1. Clone the repository locally.
```
git clone https://github.com/abenav4/livestreaming-application.git
```
2. Importantly, you need to have an active server running (and a corresponding video file) in order to run this application. Alternatively, an existing server on the web can be used as well. A helpful list of free HLS m3u8 URLs can be found at [this link](https://ottverse.com/free-hls-m3u8-test-urls/).

To alter the .m3u8 file, please modify line 38 on `index.html` by changing the value of `src` to your server address.
```
<source src="https://cph-p2p-msl.akamaized.net/hls/live/2000341/test/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL">
```
3. To install the relevant dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. To start application (in /client/)
```
npm start
```
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.
